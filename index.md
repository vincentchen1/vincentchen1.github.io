### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because this was when I felt as if I was really getting into the process of coding. Looking back, the code looks quite simple now but completing that portion felt really satisfying because of the considerable testing I did.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because of the implementation of the if-statements within the lab. When working through the conditions of when one could park on what street, the use of if-statements helped further my understanding of if-else conditions. As well as this, the use of functions was a big part of my learning experience for future labs.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite because I felt as if I really implemented my learning from the lecture into the lab. We learned about classes during the lecture and I was able to successfully show my learning through my code. I struggled to understand the concepts of classes in high school and this lab helped further my understanding on the topic.
